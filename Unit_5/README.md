## Unit 5 ‚Äì Future Trends in Security and Risk Management

This folder contains my artefacts and notes for **Unit 5** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

## üéØ Unit Overview

Unit 5 explored **current and emerging trends** shaping the future of **Security and Risk Management (SRM)**, drawing from interdisciplinary sources in **economic theory**, **artificial intelligence**, and **automation**.  
The objective was to critically evaluate these trends and determine their potential influence on both industry practice and academic research.

### Weekly Focus

- Identify and analyse *emerging SRM trends* across technical and socio-economic domains.  
- Evaluate the *advantages and risks* of these innovations.  
- Predict how each trend may influence *future research and policy directions*.  

This unit formed the conceptual foundation for the **Unit 6 seminar presentation**, where I applied the research findings to a focused topic: *AI and Automated Cyber Defence (ACD)*.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, I was able to:

- Describe **emerging trends** transforming the SRM landscape, including AI, automation, and risk quantification frameworks.  
- Critically evaluate the **pros and cons** of AI-driven cybersecurity tools.  
- Understand how **automation and data-driven governance** are reshaping security risk evaluation.  
- Apply **risk theory** (Aven, 2016) to assess uncertainty in complex adaptive systems.  
- Integrate economic and behavioural models (e.g., Kumar, 2023) with security design to enhance trust and coordination.

## üí¨ Reflection Summary

The research conducted in Unit 5 led to the development of my Unit 6 seminar presentation titled **‚ÄúAI & Automated Cyber Defence: The Next Frontier in Information Security.‚Äù**

Key insights derived from this preparatory research include:

- **Shift from static to adaptive defence:** Traditional fixed-purpose security tools are insufficient against evolving AI-driven attacks.  
- **AI in defence introduces new uncertainties:** Automation can improve scalability but also adds unpredictability, bias, and adversarial risks.  
- **Human‚ÄìAI collaboration:** Maintaining a ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù is critical to uphold accountability and ethical governance.  
- **Scientific grounding:** As Nicol et al. (2012) emphasise, scalable AI defence models must balance mathematical validity with operational realism.  
- **Socio-technical integration:** Kumar‚Äôs (2023) behavioural framework for digital ecosystems highlights the need for trust, coordination, and fairness in automated systems.  

This research not only informed the seminar but also deepened my understanding of **AI‚Äôs role in modern risk management frameworks**, bridging **technical innovation** and **ethical responsibility**.
