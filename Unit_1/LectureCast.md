# Lecture Cast – Risk and the Risk Management Process

## Lesson 1: Risk Definitions Over Time

Risk is a complex and context-dependent concept. Ensuring a shared understanding of risk among stakeholders is vital.

### 2002 — Blakely et al

> “The possibility of an event which would reduce the value of the business were it to occur. Such an event is called an *adverse event*.”  
> *Risk measure:* **Annualised Loss Expectation (ALE)** — the expected cumulative cost of risk over one year.

### 2002 — Stoneburner et al

> “The net negative impact of the exercise of a vulnerability, considering both the probability and the impact of occurrence.”  
> *Risk management* involves identifying, assessing, and reducing risk to an acceptable level.

### 2009 — Hubbard

- **Uncertainty:** Existence of more than one possible outcome.  
- **Measurement of Uncertainty:** Assigning probabilities to possibilities (e.g., 60% chance of rain).  
- **Risk:** A state of uncertainty where some possibilities involve loss or harm.

### 2014 — Josey et al

> “Risk is the probable frequency and magnitude of future loss.”  
Derived from **threat event frequency**, **vulnerability**, and **asset value**.

### 2016 — Sutton

> “Information risk is a subset of business risk and relates to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of business information assets.”  
The **Risk Process Diagram** illustrates stages from identification to treatment, following the Plan–Do–Check–Act cycle.

## Lesson 2: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)

According to ISO/IEC 27000:2012:

- **Confidentiality:** Information is not made available to unauthorised parties.  
- **Integrity:** Ensures accuracy and completeness of assets.  
- **Availability:** Accessible and usable upon demand by authorised entities.  
- **Non-repudiation:** Ability to prove the occurrence and origin of an event.

---

## Lesson 3: Threats and Vulnerabilities

- **Threat:** Potential cause of an unwanted incident causing harm.  
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness exploitable by threats.  
Threats can be *physical* (e.g., people, buildings) or *technical* (hardware, software).  
Both are assessed based on likelihood and impact, commonly through **threat modelling**.

## Lesson 4: Systems and Organisational Structure

A successful risk management programme must integrate into business systems and involve leadership.

### Hoffmann et al. (2016) propose five subsystems

1. **Strategy System** – defines tasks and objectives.  
2. **Intellectual Resource** – people and behaviours.  
3. **Technology System** – tools and equipment.  
4. **Structure System** – formal procedures.  
5. **Management System** – monitoring and goal alignment.

These subsystems interact under the **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**, following the **PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act)** model:

- **Plan:** Design the process and roles.  
- **Do:** Implement and review annually.  
- **Check:** Gather metrics and feedback.  
- **Act:** Adjust procedures and responsibilities.

## Lesson 5: Controls and Procedures

### Data Gathering Approaches (Campbell, 2016)

- **Risk Notification Mailboxes**
- **Threat Workshops**
- **Business Impact Assessments**
- **Gap Analysis**
- **Security Audits / Penetration Tests**

### Risk Analysis

- **Qualitative:** Uses categories (minor, medium, major).  
- **Quantitative:** Uses numerical or statistical data.  

### Risk Classification

1. **Eliminate** – remove entirely.  
2. **Tolerate** – accept with no further action.  
3. **Reduce** – minimise through controls.  
4. **Transfer** – share via contracts or insurance.

---

## Lesson 6: Mitigating Mechanisms

Mitigation involves **controls** such as:

- **Physical:** Guards, alarms, CCTV.  
- **Procedural:** Policies, training, revised contracts.  
- **Technical:** Firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM tools.  

**Example:**  
A document vulnerable to tampering posed high-impact, low-probability risk.  
Mitigation: store as read-only on a secure server or use version control (e.g., SharePoint).

---

## Lesson 7: Quantifying Risk

> **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Asset**

- **Qualitative Assessment:** Uses high/medium/low scales.  
- **Quantitative Assessment:** Mathematical, probabilistic, and data-driven.

### Hubbard’s “Four Horsemen” of Quantitative Assessment

1. **Actuaries** – use statistical data to calculate financial risks.  
2. **War Quants** – operations research and probabilistic modelling.  
3. **Economists** – apply theories like MPT and ROT.  
4. **Management Consultants** – criticised for qualitative bias.

### Comparison

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Qualitative | Simpler, subjective input | Limited precision |
| Quantitative | Data-driven, measurable | Requires reliable data |

Hubbard (2009) argues qualitative methods dominate standards despite quantitative superiority, though data scarcity often limits application.
