# Discussion: Risks of Digitalisation in Industry 4.0

## Definition and Examples

**Industry 4.0** is the *fourth industrial revolution* integrating technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence.  
> Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) describe Industry 4.0 as enabling “smart automation and data exchange in manufacturing and services.”

**Examples:**

- Smart factories using IoT sensors and AI for predictive maintenance.  
- Cloud-based analytics optimising inventory and logistics.  
- Digital health systems monitoring patients in real time.

Industry 4.0 creates highly connected systems that blur the boundary between the digital and physical worlds.

## Risk Categories and Real-World Examples

Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) identify six risk categories:

1. Technical  
2. Competence  
3. Employee acceptance  
4. Customer/partner acceptance  
5. Data privacy & security  
6. Financial

### Data Security Risk

The **2017 WannaCry ransomware attack** disrupted the UK NHS by encrypting systems and halting hospital services (Ghafur et al., 2019).  
This illustrates the **data privacy and security** risk of digitalisation — cyber-attacks on interconnected systems can cause severe operational and reputational damage.

### Acceptance (Behavioural) Risk

The failure of **Google Glass** (2014) exemplifies **acceptance risk**.  
Despite its innovation, users rejected it due to privacy concerns and usability issues, leading to its market withdrawal (Weidner, 2024).  
It highlights that *trust, privacy, and user perception* critically affect digital transformation success.

## Supporting Literature

Tupa et al. (2017) emphasise that most emerging risks in Industry 4.0 manufacturing relate to information security — including cyber-attacks, data loss, and integrity breaches.  
Their findings align with Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), confirming that **cybersecurity and human factors** are dominant risk areas.  
Thus, organisations must integrate proactive, systematic risk management strategies to balance innovation with resilience.
