# MSc Computer Science – Information Security Management  

## Unit 1 – An Introduction to Security and Risk Management

This repository section contains my artefacts and learning reflections for **Unit 1** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

---

## 🎯 Unit Overview

This unit introduces the **principles of information security and risk management**, providing foundational understanding of how organisations identify, assess, and mitigate risks to their information assets.  
It explores the evolution of risk definitions, core security concepts such as the **CIA triad**, and the integration of security management into organisational strategy through recognised standards and frameworks (e.g., ISO/IEC 27000 series).

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, I was able to:

- Explain key terms and concepts in **security and risk management**.  
- Evaluate how **threats, vulnerabilities, and assets** interact to determine organisational risk.  
- Discuss **qualitative and quantitative** risk assessment approaches.  
- Apply the **Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA)** cycle within an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.  
- Recognise human and organisational factors influencing security posture.

## 💬 Reflection Summary

Unit 1 established a conceptual foundation for understanding **risk as a measurable and manageable process** rather than an abstract threat.  
It highlighted the importance of aligning technical, organisational, and human perspectives when designing secure systems.  
Key takeaways include:

- The **CIA triad** remains the cornerstone of information security.  
- Frameworks such as **ISO/IEC 27000** and the **FAIR model** standardise risk assessment.  
- **Quantitative vs qualitative** methods each have value depending on context and data availability.  
- Continuous improvement through **PDCA** ensures that risk management evolves with organisational change.
