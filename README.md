# MSc Computer Science – Information Security Management  

## Digital e-Portfolio

This repository contains my complete **Information Security Management** e-Portfolio, created as part of the **MSc Computer Science** programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

The e-Portfolio demonstrates my learning, research, and technical application across six units.  
Each unit folder contains artefacts such as reports, reflections, and working prototypes that showcase both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of information security principles.

## 🎓 Module Overview

The **Information Security Management (ISM)** module provides an advanced understanding of how security principles, risk management, and governance frameworks shape modern organisations.  

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Identify and analyse **risks, threats, and vulnerabilities** in information systems.  
- Apply **risk management methodologies** such as ISO/IEC 27005, NIST RMF, and FAIR.  
- Evaluate and implement **security standards and controls** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, etc.).  
- Design and assess **disaster recovery** and **business continuity** strategies.  
- Critically assess **emerging SRM trends** such as AI-driven defence and automation.  
- Communicate technical and managerial security concepts effectively through reports, code, and presentations.
