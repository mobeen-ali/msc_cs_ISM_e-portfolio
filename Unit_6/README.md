## Unit 6 ‚Äì The Great Debate: Most Influential Trend in Information Security Management

This folder contains my artefacts and final deliverables for **Unit 6** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

## üéØ Unit Overview

Unit 6 concludes the module through an applied debate and practical demonstration.  
Students explored the question:  
> ‚ÄúWhat will be the most influential trend in Security and Risk Management (SRM) over the next five years?‚Äù

The unit integrated:

- a **research-based seminar presentation** on emerging SRM trends,  
- a **Python attack-tree application** built as an unconventional executive summary, and  
- an **individual critical reflection** linking theory, practice, and professional growth.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, I was able to:

- Describe the **main emerging trends** shaping SRM and ISM (e.g., AI-driven defence, automation, adaptive governance).  
- Argue critically for which trend will be **most influential** in the next five years.  
- Translate theoretical security frameworks into **quantitative, decision-support tools**.  
- Evaluate threats and impacts using **attack-tree methodology** (Mauw & Oostdijk, 2005; Kordy et al., 2014).  
- Demonstrate **communication and technical integration** by building a working prototype that visualises, aggregates, and interprets risk data interactively.

## üíª Summary of Application Development

As part of the executive assignment, I created a **Python-based Attack-Tree Analyzer** that:

- Accepts attack-tree specifications in **YAML/JSON**.  
- **Visualises** hierarchical threats via dynamic graph rendering.  
- Allows user-input of **probabilities and monetary impacts** at leaf nodes.  
- Aggregates data to compute **Expected Loss (E[L])** and **Probability of Success (P(top))** for the root event.  
- Compares **pre-digitalisation vs post-digitalisation** threat profiles for *Pampered Pets*.  

The methodology aligns with **ISO/IEC 27005:2018** quantitative risk analysis principles and academic foundations from **Mauw & Oostdijk (2005)** and **Kordy et al. (2014)**.  
The analysis showed a 27.8 % reduction in annualised expected loss after digitalisation, demonstrating measurable improvement through structured SRM :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

## üìä Seminar and Debate Insights

My **seminar presentation** (*AI & Automated Cyber Defence*) argued that **AI-driven automation** will define the next generation of information security.  

**Key arguments included:**

- **Adaptation and scale** ‚Äì AI enables faster pattern recognition and autonomous mitigation (Vyas et al., 2023).  
- **Adversarial vulnerabilities** ‚Äì Machine-learning models themselves become new threat surfaces (Khan & Ghafoor, 2024).  
- **Governance and trust** ‚Äì Future SRM must integrate human oversight, fairness, and transparency (Kumar, 2023; Nicol et al., 2012).  
- **Risk framework evolution** ‚Äì Aven (2016) emphasises handling ‚Äúdeep uncertainties‚Äù when deploying intelligent automation.  

These themes directly informed my argument in the debate, advocating that **AI & Automated Cyber Defence** will be the most transformative trend in ISM over the next five years :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## üí¨ Reflection Summary

The accompanying reflection consolidates my transformation from a **technology-centric** to a **risk-centric** practitioner.  
It highlights how building the Python app deepened my appreciation for:

- the importance of **quantitative reasoning** in SRM,  
- clear **communication of risk to non-technical stakeholders**, and  
- maintaining **ethical awareness** when applying automation and AI :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

This experience reinforced my ability to connect academic research, professional frameworks, and practical implementation into coherent, standards-aligned solutions.
