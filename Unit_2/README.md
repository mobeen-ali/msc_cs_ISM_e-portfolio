## Unit 2 ‚Äì Threat Modelling Exercises

This folder contains my artefact and supporting notes for **Unit 2** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

## üéØ Unit Overview

Unit 2 deepens understanding of the **Risk Management Process (RMP)** by applying it to *threat modelling*‚Äîa critical discipline for identifying, analysing, and mitigating security threats early in system design.  
Students were introduced to key industry frameworks and resources including the **Threat Modeling Manifesto**, **OWASP Cookbook**, and the **MITRE ATT&CK** database.

### Weekly Focus

- Review the **Risk Management Process**.  
- Examine differences between **qualitative** and **quantitative** assessment methods.  
- Explore **tools and frameworks** for threat identification and management.  
- Evaluate open-source and professional threat-modelling tools.  
- Develop and document **threat models** for defined scenarios.

## üß† Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this unit, I was able to:

- Identify and locate **key tools and frameworks** used in threat modelling.  
- Select appropriate modelling approaches for varying organisational contexts.  
- Apply structured techniques (e.g. **STRIDE**, **DREAD**, **MITRE ATT&CK**) to evaluate risks.  
- Visualise attack scenarios using **data-flow diagrams** and **attack trees**.  
- Critically evaluate the limitations of standardised scoring systems such as **CVSS**.

## üí¨ Reflection Summary

This unit demonstrated how **threat modelling bridges theory and real-world application** by transforming abstract risks into concrete, actionable insights.  

Key learning outcomes include:

- Understanding the **systematic flow** from asset identification to control design.  
- Recognising that **different assessment types** (qualitative vs quantitative) suit different risk contexts.  
- Appreciating the value of **visual tools** (DFDs and attack trees) for communicating complex threats.  
- Learning that **CVSS scores** alone are insufficient; contextual analysis via DREAD or FAIR adds depth.  
- Reinforcing that **proactive modelling** during design is more effective and cost-efficient than reactive mitigation.
