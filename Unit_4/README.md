# MSc Computer Science ‚Äì Information Security Management  

## Unit 4 ‚Äì Security Standards, Frameworks and Disaster Recovery

This folder contains my artefacts and reflection for **Unit 4** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

## üéØ Unit Overview

Unit 4 explores how **industry security standards** underpin risk assessment, security design, and organisational resilience.  
It also introduces **Business Continuity Management (BCM)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)**, including modern cloud-based *Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)* solutions.

### Weekly Focus

- Explore major **security standards and directives** (ISO, NIST, COBIT, PCI DSS).  
- Analyse how standards influence **risk assessments** and **control selection**.  
- Review **DR planning** and **DRaaS** approaches for business resilience.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, I was able to:

- Identify and compare leading **security frameworks** (ISO 27001/27002, NIST CSF, COBIT).  
- Explain how standards guide **risk assessment, control design, and auditing**.  
- Describe the structure and purpose of **BCM and DR planning** (RTO, RPO).  
- Evaluate **DRaaS** as a scalable recovery solution.  
- Apply these frameworks to real-world compliance cases (e.g. GDPR Case Study).

## üí¨ Reflection Summary

Through this unit I learned that **security standards translate risk theory into actionable practice**.  
Implementing structured frameworks such as **ISO 27001** or **NIST CSF** ensures that risks are identified, controlled, and monitored systematically.  

Key insights:

- **ISO 27001 / 27002** establish the baseline for an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.  
- **NIST CSF** complements ISO by mapping detailed technical controls across the five core functions (*Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover*).  
- **COBIT 5** integrates governance with IT-risk management.  
- **ISO 22301** defines BCM, focusing on restoring operations within agreed **RTO/RPO** metrics.  
- **DRaaS** offers an agile, cloud-based recovery model that reduces downtime and testing overheads.  

The **GDPR Case Study** provided a practical view of how standards and regulation intersect‚Äîshowing how failure to apply encryption (an ISO 27001 control and GDPR requirement) can lead to breaches and regulatory intervention.
