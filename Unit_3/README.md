## Unit 3 ‚Äì Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management

This folder contains my artefact and supporting notes for **Unit 3** of the *Information Security Management* module, part of the MSc Computer Science programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

## üéØ Unit Overview

Unit 3 expands on the concepts introduced in Unit 2 by examining **multiple approaches to threat modelling** and how they interrelate with risk management.  
Students explored the differences between **threats and vulnerabilities** and studied frameworks such as **STRIDE**, **DREAD**, **Attack Trees**, and hybrid methodologies like **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**.  
This unit emphasised selecting the most appropriate modelling technique‚Äîor combination‚Äîfor a given system or organisational context.

### Weekly Focus

- Differentiate between *threats* and *vulnerabilities*.  
- Review major **threat modelling techniques** and their practical applications.  
- Analyse **guides and cookbooks** (e.g., OWASP and PASTA) that support framework selection and implementation.  
- Evaluate how hybrid models enhance accuracy and contextual insight.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, I was able to:

- Describe and compare **several threat modelling techniques** (STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees, PASTA).  
- Recommend which model or hybrid approach best suits particular project contexts.  
- Apply these techniques within a **structured risk identification and assessment process**.  
- Translate findings into evidence-based recommendations aligned with **international standards (ISO 31000 & NIST CSF 2.0)**.  
- Communicate technical and governance implications clearly for SME decision-makers.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| [`ISM_Risk_Identification_Report_v0.3.md`](ISM_Risk_Identification_Report_v0.3.md) | Graded submission analysing the *Pampered Pets* SME case. The report applies ISO 31000 and NIST CSF 2.0 to identify and treat cyber and operational risks. It integrates threat modelling techniques (STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees) with standards-based control recommendations, a quantified risk register, and implementation timeline. |

## üí¨ Reflection Summary

This unit demonstrated how **threat modelling and risk management** converge in practical decision-making.  
Key insights include:

- The **relationship between threats and vulnerabilities** defines both the likelihood and potential impact of an incident.  
- Frameworks such as **STRIDE and DREAD** provide systematic yet flexible methods to assess both qualitative and quantitative risk factors.  
- **Hybrid approaches (e.g., PASTA)** combine attack simulation with business impact analysis to improve context-specific accuracy.  
- Applying **ISO 31000 governance** with **NIST CSF 2.0 controls** ensures proportional, standards-aligned implementation for SMEs.  
- Integrating **people-centric controls** (NIST SP 800-50r1) alongside technical measures reduces residual human-factor risk.  

Overall, Unit 3 reinforced the value of combining **methodological rigour** with **operational pragmatism** when transforming theoretical risk frameworks into actionable security strategy.
